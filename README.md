This is just another CHIP-8 implementation written in Python. For the
uninitiated, CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, but the virtual
machine has a lot in common with actual hardware, so it gets used often as a
'Hello World' type program for emulator writing. This is something I whipped up
real quick as a refresher before I try tackling a gameboy emulator.

Project uses pipenv to manage dependencies. Only real dependency here is
pygame.
