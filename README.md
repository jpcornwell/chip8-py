This is just another CHIP-8 implementation written in Python. For the
uninitiated, CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, but the virtual
machine has a lot in common with actual hardware, so it gets used often as a
'Hello World' type program for emulator writing. This is something I whipped up
real quick as a refresher before I try tackling a gameboy emulator.

Project uses pipenv to manage dependencies. Only real dependency here is
pygame.


NOTE - This project has been abandoned
--------------------------------------

This project was just a small weekend project to help familiarize myself again
with how to write a basic emulator. It is mostly finished, but one or two
instructions have been left unimplemented. I decided to change direction and
start work on an implementation done in C. I've actually already done this
before in Python many years ago, so there is little point in me doing it again.
Doing this in C will help me refresh on that language, and it'll allow me to
learn SDL, which I think will be useful in the future. That being said, I'll go
ahead and keep the code around.
